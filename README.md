# Friend Finder

A simple 'matchmaking' website for finding friends! Answer a few simple personality questions
and see who most aligns with you.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone to repo to your computer. Navigate to the directory in your terminal
and run 'npm i' to install the necessary packages. Currently, this code is by default written to run
either on a hosted server, or through a localhost server. For testing purposes, the localhost is
easiest to setup. While in the repo directory, run the server.js file through node (type in 'node server.js').
Then open up your favorite web browser and navigate to 'http://locahost:8080'. The site should be up
and running locally! That's it!

### Prerequisites

You will need to install all npm packages as described above.

### Installing

1. Clone the repo to a location of your choosing on your computer.
2. Navigate to the directory in your bash terminal.
3. Install all necessary packages by typing 'npm i'.
4. Use Node to run the 'server.js' file. To do this, simply type 'node server.js'. (You might need to install Node first.)
5. Open up an internet-browser, and navigate to 'http://localhost:8080'.
6. Test the site!

## Deployment

This project is currently hosted on Heroku for testing purposes. To deploy, you will need to host all included files
on your own server.
